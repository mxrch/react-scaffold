# React Scaffold

A simple project to quickly start a React project with all the most needed dependencies I personally have.

It contains :
- Typescript
- SWC compiler (fast, Rust-based)
- Vite
- Tailwind
- Flowbite
- Yarn (zero NPM)

After the git clone, just :
```bash
$ yarn # Install the dependencies
$ yarn dev # Launch with Vite (+ hot reload)
```

And you'll see this beautiful default web page :
